    "pytext": `This is a year of victory where you can acquire spiritual mastery by learning to control your lower instincts and emotions. Take a break from the pressures of your daily activities to still your mind and restore your spirit. Reflect on what is meaningful to you and serves your purpose. If you can find time in nature, it will nourish every part of you, particularly if you retreat near the ocean.
    You might find you want to relocate closer to nature or live in a more serene environment, or at least go on a vacation. If you do not have a daily meditation practice, you might consider taking one up.
    This is an ideal time to engage in any spiritual activity or group where you can learn more about your chosen faith with others. Any course of study or research will prove worthwhile provided your heart is in it, and you are not doing it out of obligation.
    If you are a writer, this can be the year to create your best work yet! No matter what you engage in this year, you want to keep your mind focused on what you want, rather than let your emotions get the better of you.
    At times, you might feel that your emotions or outward circumstances are tearing you in two directions, leaving you angry or confused. This is an opportunity for you to gain dominion over your mind, so that you feel in control of your life, rather than feeling that circumstances in your life occur at random.
    If you find yourself getting overwhelmed, take a deep breath and stay in the moment. Stay focused on the big picture, and ask yourself if you have been making choices based on your personal truth, or if you have allowed other's opinions to dominate your decision.
    As you learn to stay centered amidst change, you will learn to deeply trust yourself and the process of your life. These are valuable skills that will carry you forward for the rest of your journey.
