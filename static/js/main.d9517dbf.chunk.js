If you've been neglecting your home, and responsibilities to it, today would be a good day to turn your attention back there. Home, family and friends is today's theme and that is where your attention belongs on a 6 day.\n    \n    "},{id:"pd7",pdtext:'A day of rest. Today is your personal "Sunday". Do not try to force ahead with your plans on this day. Today is for contemplation, introspection and meditation. Plan ahead but rest today and wait for the next day to put plans into action. You can use today for study and research and to further your knowledge. If you need to work use today for training yourself with new skills or knowledge. Today you must allow things to come to you. You may feel low in energy today so have a nap during the day, sleep in if you can or go to bed earlier!\n    '},{id:"pd8",pdtext:"This is your executive power day. You will be at your most powerful allowing you to take charge and be in control of what you do. You will have ambition, be disciplined, practical and take a realistic approach to achieving your goals. As the number 8 is a closed loop, or upright infinity symbol, you my feel the effects of karma on this day. Whatever you have sown in the past, today is the day you shall reap any rewards or consequences. It can be material day with a focus on accumulating money and possessions but as well as possible gains this can also be a day in which there are loses. If you can further your financial standing then today is the day to push forward and make those gains. Emotional bonds or interests are likely to be put aside to allow you the clarity of thought and purpose you'll need to achieve your goals. If you feel blocked or confused use you intuition which will be especially keen today to guide your decisions.\n\n    "},{id:"pd9",pdtext:'Today is the day to clean up and clear out of your life anything that has outstayed its welcome. A good day to end a bad relationship. "Pull up the weeds", in your life today. Finish all those jobs and tasks that are still there to be done. This is a day of endings. It you started a new project on a 1 personal day then today is the day you should finish it. As the number 9 is the number of mankind, today is a day to be a humanitarian.\n    '}],I=[{id:"lp1",lptext:"You are creative and dedicated, which means you\u2019re naturally disposed to stick to the goals you set and should be innately gifted at Law of Attraction techniques such as visualization and dream board creation (so these may hold more power for you than, say, verbal affirmations).\n      However, the shadow side of Life Path number 1 is dependent on the needs, desires, and opinions of others. As such, you might be trying to manifest things you don\u2019t actually want! You may be too busy to please people, instead of finding the courage to live the life you desire.\n      Try an exercise that truly connects you with your own values. For example, write down the five things that matter most to you, that you\u2019d value even if you could gain no praise or criticism for them. Now, ask yourself: What life goals should you set in accordance with these values? These are things you should really be trying to manifest. However, you may still find it difficult to aim for these goals in an independent, confident and autonomous way, so you may benefit from further exercises that help you combat this aspect of your life number.\n      \n      "},{id:"lp2",lptext:"You\u2019re an emotionally sensitive, genuine person who practices congruence and honesty, so it\u2019s probably not too hard for you to tune into your heart\u2019s desires when working with the Law of Attraction.\n\n      On the other hand, Life Path number 2 comes with a challenging tendency to feel defeated and hopelessness in the face of difficulties or criticism. You\u2019re likely to focus on the potential negatives of any situation, and this fear can stop you from manifesting. You need a more positive mindset!\n      To shed some of that negativity, try to work out where your critical inner voice comes from.\n\nDoes it sound like a particular family member, teacher or past partner? And what does it say?\n\nWrite down some of the self-defeating belief you hold, and really look at them. Then, turn them into positive questions. For example \u201cI could never do that\u201d can become \u201cWhat could I do to start making it possible for me to do that?\u201d.\n\nYou could also benefit from finding ways to boost your energy levels, as lethargy is part of the shadow side of most Life path number 2s. There are mantras, meditations and physical tasks that can help you there.\n      "},{id:"lp3",lptext:"One of the best things about being a Life Path number 3 is that you\u2019re socially magnetic. As such, if networking, romance or anything else involving people is part of your Law of Attraction work, you\u2019ll have a definite advantage right away. You\u2019re also quite optimistic most of the time. This can stoke the fire of positivity you need if you\u2019re going to manifest effectively.\n\n      That being said, this Life Path number is also linked to a certain flippancy and difficulty with commitment at times. Consequently, you might find it hard to pin down just one thing you want to manifest and end up devoting only a little bit of energy to a wide range of goals.\n      Mindfulness exercises are an excellent way of stopping this shadow side of your Life Path number from getting in your way. They will teach you focus and discipline, helping you to hone into one thing at a time.\n\n    Start by simply spending 10-15 minutes focusing on your breathing and letting other thoughts drift by. Later, you can graduate to a visualization journey that helps you find your true goal.\n      "},{id:"lp4",lptext:"Those with a Life Path number of 4 are blessed with a strong will and a practical personality. As such, you\u2019re likely to know exactly what you need to do to get the desired end result, which will definitely help you formulate a fantastic plan to go with your use of the Law of Attraction. You are also one of the numbers most likely to have faith that the Law of Attraction really will work.\n\n      The unfortunate shadow side of a Life Path number 4, however, involves missing certain spontaneous opportunities due to a rigid perspective, and having a lower likelihood of attaining wealth.\n      The good news is that you can use key Law of Attraction techniques to manifest more money. Once you know what you want the money for, and how much you really need, do a daily visualization that involves a vivid picture of yourself enjoying the financial success to come.\n\n        Don\u2019t just see it, feel it, smell it, and see it. You might also benefit from exercises that encourage you to outline your positive and negative beliefs about money and help you focus on maintaining a positive attitude towards it.\n      "},{id:"lp5",lptext:"One of the major benefits of being born with a Life Path number of 5 is that you\u2019re an open-minded, flexible thinker who is able to find solutions outside the box. You\u2019re also anchored in the present moment much of the time, which mean you\u2019re very aware of current experiences and less likely to get bogged down by memories of the past or worries about the future.\n\n      On a more negative note, number 5s can be on the self-indulgent side, feeling attracted to transient pleasures rather than fully trying to manifest lasting change. You might also tend to be a little bit self-focused. You need to radiate a positive attitude towards others if you\u2019re going to use the Law of Attraction to its full potential.\n      To begin spreading more positivity, try setting yourself the task of doing a random act of kindness each day (whether it\u2019s letting someone behind you skip the queue for coffee, complimenting a stranger or calling a lonely friend). Once you expand your worldview and start looking outwards more often, you can move on to the task of trying to ascertain your deepest desires, looking past the superficial, fun wants that are initially so tempting.\n      \n      "},{id:"lp6",lptext:"The great thing about having 6 as your Life Path number is that you\u2019re so compassionate and generous that you can\u2019t help but spread goodness wherever you go. You\u2019re a nurturer and are full of loving energy! This helps you maintain just the right attitude of hope when it comes to the Law of Attraction.\n\n      The flipside of being a Life Path number 6, however, is that you\u2019re always giving so much to others that you may have trouble finding the time to do things you love. As such, you might always be just out of reach of the life you want to use the Law of Attraction to create.\n      One of the most important things you can do is learn new techniques for self-care.\n\n    Try to see that your value extends beyond what you can offer to others.\n\n    For example, try making a list of the things you like about yourself, without referring to anything that depends on what you do for people. So, you can include \u201ccreative\u201d but not \u201cgood listener\u201d or \u201cput others first\u201d (for example). Put this list in a prominent place and use it to remind you that your worth is intrinsic. From there, it\u2019ll be a matter of carving out time for your beloved hobbies and goals and learning how to draw better boundaries between self and others.\n      \n      "},{id:"lp7",lptext:"If you have a Life Path number of 7, you\u2019re a peaceful and reflective person who knows how to enjoy a connection with others without letting it define your life. As such, if you\u2019re looking to use the Law of Attraction to find love, you\u2019ve already got the kind of mindset that fosters a balanced, satisfying relationship.\n\n      On the other hand, you may struggle to appreciate certain things you have. Similarly, you may find it harder than the average person to believe that the Law of Attraction really can work.\n      To work against this shadow side of your number, try making more of an effort to connect with your spiritual, intuitive nature (rather than just using the analytical part of your mind). Meditating, taking daily photographs of moments of beauty and keeping a gratitude journal may all be helpful. A gratitude journal will also help you grow more positivity. This is especially effective if you challenge yourself to find the silver lining in everyday challenges. However, this will be a work in progress. You\u2019ll likely need further exercises to become positive enough to manifest your ideal life.\n      "},{id:"lp8",lptext:"Being born with a Life Path number of 8 means you\u2019re innately determined, focused and thoughtful. You\u2019re also likely to be confident and practical, which makes you a great organizer.\n      However, this practicality also means that you tend to devote very little time to dream. In addition, you may not be able to easily practice daily visualizations like some other Life Path numbers can. There is also a possibility that you\u2019re focused on material goods to the exclusion of things that have more emotional value. As a result, you may struggle to find lasting love.\n      Some of the best ways to grow past these limitations will focus on letting yourself feel your emotions instead of repressing or ignoring them. One way to facilitate this is to look at why you might not feel comfortable with emotion.\n\n        For example, you might begin by writing down what you\u2019ve learned about each emotion. What did your family teach you about what it means to be angry, happy, fearful or hopeful, for example? Uncovering some of the messages you received can help you to reject the ones that no longer serve you. When you do this and pursue other tasks that help you connect with your true feelings, you\u2019ll have a better idea of your deepest desires, and better use of the Law of Attraction will follow.\n      "},{id:"lp9",lptext:"People tend to automatically respect someone with a Life Path number of 9, as this number makes you an honorable person with a keen sense of fairness. You\u2019re also charismatic, and others are often immediately interested in you. This magnetism can be harnessed as you try to attract all the things you want in life.\n\n      Unfortunately, your shadow side can get in the way here. You might have a negative obsession with having a successful career or achieving financial freedom. Having negative thoughts about these desired things only stops you from getting them!\n      If you\u2019re aware that you tend to be negative or fearful about the things you really want, try a simple exercise that begins to reform your beliefs.\n\n        Write the name of the relevant concept in the center of a piece of paper, say, money, or career success. Then, surround the word with good associations and positive beliefs. So, for money, you might write \u201callows me to travel\u201d and \u201cmeans I don\u2019t often need to worry about comfort or safety\u201d. Write as if you already have the money you want. Pin the paper up where you can see it. This is the start of learning how to live \u201cin the knowing\u201d, a key concept for those who want to make the most of the Law of Attraction.\n\n\n      "}],N=a(83),C=(a(71),function(e){Object(u.a)(a,e);var t=Object(d.a)(a);function a(e){var o;return Object(l.a)(this,a),(o=t.call(this,e)).newDayInput=function(e){o.setState({dayValue:e.target.value})},o.newMonthInput=function(e){o.setState({monthValue:e.target.value})},o.newYearInput=function(e){o.setState({yearValue:e.target.value})},o.newCardHeader=function(e){o.setState({cardHeaderText:e.target.value})},o.newGreetingText=function(e){o.setState({greetingText:e.target.value})},o.createCard=function(e,t){for(var a=parseInt(e)+parseInt(t),n=0;a>0;)n+=a%10,a=Math.floor(a/10);o.setState({monthDaySum:n,headerText:"Your Personal Year number is  ",cardForecastHeader:"YOUR NUMEROLOGY FORECAST FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR",modalShow:!0})},o.showModal=function(){o.setState({modalShow:!0})},o.hideModal=function(){o.setState({modalShow:!1})},o.state={dayValue:1,monthValue:1,monthDaySum:"",cardHeaderText:"",greetingText:"",cardForecastHeader:"",modalShow:!1},o}return Object(h.a)(a,[{key:"render",value:function(){for(var e=this,t=[],a=2021;a>1920;a--){var n=Object(o.jsx)("option",{value:a,children:a},a);t.push(n)}for(var i=[],r=1;r<32;r++){var s=Object(o.jsxs)("option",{value:r,children:[" ",r]},r);i.push(s)}var l="";return 1==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[0].pytext:2==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[1].pytext:3==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[2].pytext:4==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[3].pytext:5==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[4].pytext:6==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[5].pytext:7==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[6].pytext:8==this.state.monthDaySum?l=this.props.yearForecastData[7].pytext:9==this.state.monthDaySum&&(l=this.props.yearForecastData[8].pytext),Object(o.jsx)("div",{className:"c-home-forecast-page",children:Object(o.jsxs)(f.a,{children:[Object(o.jsxs)(m.a,{children:[Object(o.jsxs)(p.a,{xs:12,md:8,className:"yellow-col-card",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h5",{className:"card-page-header",children:"CREATE PERSONALIZED BIRTHDAY CARDS"}),Object(o.jsx)("p",{children:"Create personalized birthday cards for your friend or loved one with a personalized yearly numerology forecast Your friends, family or loved one will cherish this unique birthday cards. add personalized greeting text and enter the person birth date to get the yearly birthday forecast.
